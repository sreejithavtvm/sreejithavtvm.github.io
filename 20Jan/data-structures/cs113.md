## Assignments
| # |  |  Problem |
| :--:| :---: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- | 
| |   | Programming assignments |
| 1 |  | 1. Implement add, remove elements in the front and back of linked list. <br> 2.  Create C++ class which simulates basic operations of stack and queue using linked list. <br> 3. Create a BigInteger class which stores as big an integer we want and write operations for addition and multiplication. |
| 2 |  | Family tree - Build a data structure to store information about father, mother and children. Note that a person can have children with more than one person. <br> You will then need to write a function, which takes two person and tell their relationship. <br> The output can be one of the following: father, mother, grand father/mother, i-th great grand father/mother, or i-th cousin j-removed. <br> See https://www.genealogy.com/articles/research/16_cousn.html for proper terminology about family relationships.|
| 3 |  | From inorder and postorder information build the tree|
| 4 |  | 1. Write an algorithm to print all k size permutations of an n element set (with and without repetitions). <br> 2. Implement a stack using two queues. <br> 3. Implement a queue using two stacks.|
