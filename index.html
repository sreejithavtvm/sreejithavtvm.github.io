						<div id="doca" style="display: none;">
					<p>
						<b>Introduction</b>:
						Finite automata models complex systems, from computational processes to biological
						phenomena. Deterministic one-counter automata (DOCA) extend finite automata with an
						integer counter, enabling the modeling of certain infinite-state systems. DOCAs are
						strictly more expressive than finite automata, making them promising candidates for replacing finite
						automata in applications, provided scalable algorithms can be developed. This research aims to
						advance the understanding and applicability of DOCAs.
					</p>
					<p><b>Contributions</b>: We addressed two key problems. <br>
						<i>Equivalence of weighted DOCA:</i> For a large subclass we showed the problem is in P 
						[<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13456">fsttcs23</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03066">icla25</a>].
						To prove this, we introduced a reachability problem. Using combinatorial techniques 
						along with linear algebra we showed that the problem is in P.
						The equivalence problem for the full class remains a fundamental open problem.<br>

						<i>Active learning algorithms for DOCAs:</i>  
								Developed a SAT-based algorithm [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08815">tacas25</a>]
								that learns a minimal DOCA. Since minimization is NP-hard, we cannot avoid SAT to 
								learn a minimal DOCA. However, we can learn a DOCA in polynomial time (not necessarily minimal) as shown in our work [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04525">lics25</a>].

				<h5>Countable words (<a onclick="myFunction('countable')">click for details</a>)</h5> <ul>
					<div id="countable" style="display: none;">
				<p>
					<b>Introduction</b>: This work is at the meeting point of two important branches of language theory: 
					(1) Extension of finite word language theories: This branch explores structures beyond finite words, 
					such as infinite words and infinite trees. 
					(2) Characterization of logics: This branch focuses on identifying and classifying logics. The 
					classic work of Schutzenberger on the equivalence
					of first-order logic and aperiodic monoids in finite words falls here.
					
					We study countable words, the largest extension that is known to have a theory of recognizability.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Contributions</b>: In [<a href="papers/countableLinearOrder_CS.pdf">icalp15</a>] we provided the 
					first algebraic characterization of intermediate logics like first-order logic (FO), and its various extensions
					like FO with cuts, weak MSO, FO with ordinal quantifiers, and FO with scattered quantifiers. The paper
					gives a structure theorem for o-monoids. This enables a deep understanding of various classes of o-monoids.
					In a subsequent paper, [<a href="papers/mfcs16_MS.pdf">mfcs16</a>] we showed a similar characterization for FO2. 
					Subsequently, in a series of papers we characterized various FO extensions like FO[infinity], temporal logic and 
					provide the first decomposition results for o-monoids [<a href="papers/BPPandFO.pdf">lics19</a>,
					<a href="papers/fct21.pdf">fct21</a>, <a href="papers/jcss23.pdf">jcss23</a>,

					<b>Introduction</b>:
					Logic provides a precise framework to express mathematical properties unambiguously. It plays a 
					vital role in areas like descriptive complexity, and set theory 
					(see <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/papers/unreasonable/basl.pdf">survey</a>). 
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Contributions</b>:
					Our work introduced modulo counting operators, thereby enhancing the expressiveness of logics.
					Key contributions (see <a href="papers/RegularQuantifiersThesis_sreejithav.pdf">my thesis</a> ) include 
					(1) Extending Linear temporal logic (LTL) with modulo counting operators, enhancing its expressive-
					ness while retaining PSPACE complexity for model checking [<a href="papers/ltlmod.pdf">m4m11</a>,
					<a href="papers/LTLsuccinct_LS.pdf">atva10</a>].
					(2) Extending first-order logic with modulo counting operators [<a href="papers/dlt17_LS.pdf">dlt17</a>].
					When the logic has the predicate addition, they form highly uniform circuit classes. In 
					[<a href="papers/CraneBeachFOGRP_KS.pdf">lics12</a>] we show separation results among these logics.

						We propose One-counter Positive Negative Inference (OPNI), a passive learning algorithm for deterministic real-time one-counter automata (DROCA). Inspired by the RPNI algorithm for regular languages, OPNI constructs a DROCA consistent with any given valid sample set. We further present a method for combining OPNI with active learning of DROCA, and provide an implementation of the approach. Our experimental results demonstrate that this approach scales more effectively than existing state-of-the-art algorithms. We also evaluate the performance of the proposed approach for learning visibly one-counter automata.

					   <span>
						We investigate the expressive power of regular expressions for languages of countable words and establish their expressive equivalence with logical and algebraic characterizations. Our goal is to extend the classical theory of regular languages - defined over finite words and characterized by automata, monadic second-order logic, and regular expressions - to the setting of countable words. In this paper, we introduce and study five classes of expressions: marked star-free expressions, marked expressions, power-free expressions, scatter-free expressions, and scatter expressions. We show that these expression classes characterize natural fragments of logic over countable words and possess decidable algebraic characterizations. As part of our algebraic analysis, we provide a precise description of the relevant classes in terms of their J-class structure. These results complete a triad of equivalences - between logic, algebra, and expressions - in this richer setting, thereby generalizing foundational results from classical formal language theory.

						We give an active learning algorithm for deterministic one-counter automata (DOCAs) where the learner can ask the teacher membership and minimal equivalence queries. The algorithm called OL* learns a DOCA in time polynomial in the size of the smallest DOCA, recognising the target language. <br>
						
						All existing algorithms for learning DOCAs, even for the subclasses of deterministic real-time one-counter automata (DROCAs) and visibly one-counter automata (VOCAs), in the worst case, run in exponential time with respect to the size of the DOCA under learning. Furthermore, previous learning algorithms are "grey-box" algorithms relying on an additional query type - counter value query - where the teacher returns the counter value reached on reading a given word. In contrast, our algorithm is a "black-box" algorithm. <br>
						
						It is known that the minimisation of VOCAs is NP-hard. However, OL* can be used for approximate minimisation of DOCAs. In this case, the output size is at most polynomial in the size of a minimal DOCA.

					<b> Abstract </b>:
					<span>
						In this paper, we introduce a novel method for active learning of deterministic real-time one-counter 
						automata (DROCA). The existing techniques for learning DROCA rely on observing the behaviour of the 
						DROCA up to exponentially large counter-values. Our algorithm eliminates this need and requires only a 
						polynomial number of queries. Additionally, our method differs from existing techniques as we learn a 
						minimal counter-synchronous DROCA, resulting in much smaller counter-examples on equivalence queries. 
						Learning a minimal counter-synchronous DROCA cannot be done in polynomial time unless P = NP, even in 
						the case of visibly one-counter automata. We use a SAT solver to overcome this difficulty. The solver 
						is used to compute a minimal separating DFA from a given set of positive and negative samples.<br> <br>
						
						We prove that the equivalence of two counter-synchronous DROCAs can be checked significantly faster 
						than that of general DROCAs. For visibly one-counter automata, we have discovered an even faster 
						algorithm for equivalence checking. We implemented the proposed learning algorithm and tested it on 
						randomly generated DROCAs. Our evaluations show that the proposed method outperforms the existing 
						techniques on the test set.

						<b> Abstract </b>:

							We introduce weighted one-deterministic-counter automata (ODCA). These are weighted one-counter 
							automata (OCA) with the property of counter-determinacy, meaning that all paths labelled by a given 
							word starting from the initial configuration have the same counter-effect. Weighted ODCAs are a 
							strict extension of weighted visibly OCAs, which are weighted OCAs where the input alphabet determines 
							the actions on the counter. <br> <br>
							We present a novel problem called the co-VS (complement to a vector space) reachability problem for 
							weighted ODCAs over fields, which seeks to determine if there exists a run from a given configuration 
							of a weighted ODCA to another configuration whose weight vector lies outside a given vector space. 
							We establish two significant properties of witnesses for co-VS reachability: they satisfy a pseudo-
							pumping lemma, and the lexicographically minimal witness has a special form. It follows that the co-VS 
							reachability problem is in P. <br> <br>
							These reachability problems help us to show that the equivalence problem of weighted ODCAs over fields 
							is in P by adapting the equivalence proof of deterministic real-time OCAs by Böhm et al. This is a step 
							towards resolving the open question of the equivalence problem of weighted OCAs. Furthermore, we 
							demonstrate that the regularity problem, the problem of checking whether an input weighted ODCA over a 
							field is equivalent to some weighted automaton, is in P. Finally, we show that the covering and 
							coverable equivalence problems for uninitialised weighted ODCAs are decidable in polynomial time. 
							We also consider boolean ODCAs and show that the equivalence problem for (non-deterministic) boolean 
							ODCAs is in PSPACE, whereas it is undecidable for (non-deterministic) boolean OCAs.

							<b> Abstract </b>:
							<span>
								We propose an innovative methodology to estimate the formative discharge of alluvial rivers from remote sensing
								images.
								This procedure involves automatic extraction of the width of a channel from Landsat Thematic Mapper,
								Landsat 8, and Sentinel-1 satellite images. We translate the channel width extracted from satellite images to
								discharge by using a width- discharge regime curve established previously by us for the Himalayan Rivers.
								This regime curve is based on the threshold theory, a simple physical force balance that explains the
								first-order geometry of alluvial channels. Using this procedure, we estimate the discharge of six major
								rivers of the Himalayan Foreland: the Brahmaputra, Chenab, Ganga, Indus, Kosi, and Teesta rivers.
								Except highly regulated rivers (Indus and Chenab), our estimates of the discharge from satellite images
								can be compared with the mean annual discharge obtained from historical records of gauging stations.
								We have shown that this procedure applies both to braided and single-thread rivers over a large territory.
								Further our methodology to estimate discharge from remote sensing images does not rely on continuous ground
								calibration.

							<b> Abstract </b>:
							<span>Etessami,
								Vardi and Wilke showed that satisfiability of two-variable first order
								logic FO<sup>2</sup>[&lt;] on word models is Nexptime-complete.
								We extend this upper bound to the slightly stronger logic
								FO<sup>2</sup>[&lt;,successor,equiv], which allows checking whether a
								word
								position is congruent to r modulo q, for some divisor q and remainder
								r. If we allow the more powerful modulo counting quantifiers of
								Straubing, Therien and Thomas (we call this two-variable fragment
								FOMOD<sup>2</sup>[&lt;,successor]), satisfiability becomes
								Expspace-complete. A
								more general counting quantifier, FOCOUNT<sup>2</sup>[&lt;,successor],
								makes the logic undecidable. </span>

							<b> Abstract </b>:
							<span>We
								study the class of
								languages of finitely-labelled countable linear orderings definable in
								two-variable first-order logic. We give a number of characterisations,
								in particular an algebraic one in terms of circle monoids, using
								equations. This generalises the corresponding characterisation, namely
								variety DA, over finite words to the countable case. A corollary is
								that the membership in this class is decidable: for instance given an
								MSO formula it is possible to check if there is an equivalent
								two-variable logic formula
								over countable linear orderings. In addition, we prove that the
								satisfiability problems for two-variable logic over arbitrary,
								countable, and scattered linear orderings are
								Nexptime-complete. </span>

							<b> Abstract </b>:
							<span>We
								consider first-order logic with monoidal quantifiers. We show that all
								languages with a neutral letter, definable using the addition numerical
								predicate are also definable with the order predicate as the only
								numerical predicate. Since we prove this result for arbitrary subsets
								of the monoidal quantifiers, the following holds in the presence of a
								neutral letter: For aperiodic monoids, we get the result of Libkin that
								FO[&lt;, +] collapses to FO[&lt;]; For solvable monoids, we get the
								result of Roy and Straubing that FO+MOD[&lt;, +] collapses to
								FO+MOD[&lt;]; For cyclic groups, we answer an open question of Roy and
								Straubing, proving that MOD[&lt;, +] collapses to MOD[&lt;].
								All these results can be viewed as collapse results for the uniformity
								of constant depth circuits, and in this sense as a separation result
								for very uniform circuit classes. For example we separate
								FO[&lt;,+]-uniform CC<sup>0</sup> from FO[&lt;,+]-uniform ACC<sup>0</sup>.

							<b> Abstract </b>:
							<span>It
								is well known that modelchecking and satisfiability of Linear Temporal
								Logic (LTL) are Pspace-complete. Wolper showed that
								with grammar operators, this result can be extended to increase the
								expressiveness of the logic to all regular languages. Other ways of
								extending the expressiveness of LTL using modular and group modalities
								have been explored by Baziramwabo, McKenzie and Th\'erien, which are
								expressively complete for regular languages recognized by solvable
								monoids and for all regular languages, respectively. In all the papers
								mentioned, the numeric constants used in the modalities are in unary
								notation. We show that in some cases (such as the modular and symmetric
								group modalities) we can use numeric constants in binary notation,
								and still maintain the Pspace upper bound. Adding modulo counting to
								LTL[F] (with just the unary future modality) already makes the logic
								Pspace-hard. We also consider a restricted logic which allows only
								the modulo counting of length from the beginning of the word. Its
								satisfiability is Sigmathree-complete.</span>
